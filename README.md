~> Patient–Doctor Management System :-

~> About

This is a console-based C++ project I built for my Intermediate Programming class.
It simulates a simple hospital system where you can view/manage patients and physicians and update which doctor a patient is assigned to.
The program loads data from CSV files (edited in Microsoft Excel) and writes updates back to the patient CSV.

~>  What the Program Does
- Loads patient data from a CSV file
- Loads doctor (physician) data from a CSV file
- Maintains lists of patients and doctors using vectors
- Allows assigning or updating a doctor for a patient
- Displays patient and doctor information
- Uses a menu-driven console interface for user interaction
- Writes updated patient data back to the CSV file

~>  Data Files (CSV / Excel)
The program uses two CSV files that can be edited using Microsoft Excel.

~>  Expected file formats

Physician.csv

Patient.csv

These files should be placed in the same folder as the program (or inside a data folder if using relative paths).

~>  Why I Built This
I built this project as part of my coursework to strengthen my understanding of:
- Classes and objects in C++
- Working with vectors to store and manage data
- File input/output using CSV files
- Structuring a program into logical components
- Writing clear and readable console-based programs

~> Concepts is used to build this project.
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Vectors and basic data structures
- File I/O (CSV)
- Conditional logic and loops
- Console input/output

Note:  
The first row of each CSV file contains column headers. The program skips the header row when reading the data.
