~> Patient–Doctor Management System

~> About
This is a C++ console-based project I built for an intermediate programming course. The goal of the project was to practice object-oriented programming and basic data structure concepts by simulating a simple system for managing patients and doctors.

~> What the Program Does:
- Maintains lists of patients and doctors
- Allows assigning or updating a doctor for a patient
- Displays patient and doctor information
- Uses a menu-driven console interface for user interaction

~> Why I Built This:
I built this project as part of my coursework to strengthen my understanding of:
- Object-oriented programming in C++
- Working with vectors to store and manage data
- Program flow using conditions and loops
- Writing clean and readable console-based code

~> Concepts i used to build this project:
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes and objects)
- Vectors and basic data structures
- Conditional logic and loops
- Console input/output

~> How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talhayousaf01/patient-doctor-management-system.git
